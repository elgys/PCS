For running this project you need at least python version 3.6 and the libraries
numpy, matplotlib, pymunk and pygame need to be installed.

You can get the graph files by first running main.py with the flag --file and
the correct .exc file. (See main.py -h for all available flags.)
This runs the simulation, gets the data.
Then run plotter.py with the correct .res file that is generated by main.py.
This plots the graph.
