For running this project you need at least python version 3.6 and the libraries
numpy, matplotlib, pymunk and pygame need to be installed.

You can get the graph files by:
- first running main.py with the flag --file and the correct .exc file,
  this runs the simulation and gets the data.
  (e.g. python3 main.py --file ./exercises/T_pose.exc)
  (See main.py -h for all available flags.)
- Then run plotter.py with the correct .res file that is generated by main.py,
  this plots the graph.
  (e.g. python3 plotter.py ./results/T_pose.res)
